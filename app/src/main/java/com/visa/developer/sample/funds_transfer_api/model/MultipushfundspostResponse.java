/*
 * Funds Transfer API
 * The Funds Transfer API can pull funds from the sender&apos;s Visa account (in preparation for pushing funds to a recipient&apos;s account) in an Account Funding Transaction (AFT).  Additionally, the Funds Transfer API also provides functionality to push funds to the recipient&apos;s Visa account in an Original Credit Transaction (OCT).  If a transaction is declined, the Funds Transfer API can also return the funds to the sender&apos;s funding source in an Account Funding Transaction Reversal (AFTR). The API has been enhanced to allow originators to send their PushFundsTransactions(OCTs) and PullFundsTransactions(AFTs) to Visa for routing to multiple U.S. debit networks.
